# RC3 Living Architecture

## Workshop 1 - Encoded Assemblies

### Description
The workshop investigates Cellular Automata and specifically Conway’s game of life as a starting
point for generating the growth of three dimensional structures. Each team will develop a 3d
CA/game of life in Unity in which the starting geometric seeds and game of life rules can be triggered
and changed based on local conditions to produce adaptive structures. Each team will develop
methods of local and global analysis of the structures based on density (local neighbourhood, over a layer, and global), age of each cell, connectivity, and structural stability and other quantifiable systemic features. These metrics will then be used as a feedback mechanism in the triggering of local rules to develop differentiated structures.

### Goals
Develop an understanding of the influence of the input parameters and local rules on the behaviour of the design model. Develop automated methods of analysing and quantifying local and global conditions in a complex organization with many parts. Use this analysis to extract and understand useful relationships between rules and local conditions leading to behavioural tendencies in the resulting structures. Develop a direct feedback between quantified analysis of local and global conditions and the implementation / triggering of local rules to develop a controlled growth model. Develop a “DNA” syntax which encodes each specific set of combined starting conditions/input parameters, local rules, and thresholds for changing local decisions.

### Design Outcome
The above system should be applied to the design of a series of tables which would be prototyped as a set of small scaled 3d prints.

### Deadline (Tentative)
Monday, November 10th, 2018

### Deliverables
1. Physical constructs
   - A small series of scaled 3d printed models of tables produced by your CA /GOL
  
2. Final presentation
    - Diagrams explaining the input parameters, local neighbourhoods, algorithmic rules used to generate the structures
    - Diagrams explaining methods / metrics for analysing and quantifying local and global results
    - Iterative catalogues describing each experiment (relationship being studied, input parameters/rules, visualized and quantified analysis results, and outcomes) – this should follow a basic scientific method to test each parameter and how it impacts the resulting behaviour of the system
    - Description / diagrams of a DNA syntax which encodes your local rules, starting parameters and thresholds for local decision making
